    Your Dad is glad that you are understanding and sits with you while you do your homework.
    He tries to help you at various times, but he's forgotten all the math he learned in
    school. You gently shush him when he tries to remember the Pythagorean Theorem and finish
    your math on your own. Then your Mom comes home from the store with a tray of Mochaccinos and
    you all celebrate.
