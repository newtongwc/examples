This directory contains some simple examples of python programs that you can run locally
in PyCharm's Python Console. Just hit the "Run" icon (the green triangle).

Contents:

* hello.py: a classic. Says hello.

* rock-paper-scissors-students.py: an implementation of Rock, Paper, Scissors that
  the Tuesday night GWC class wrote together in Codesters. This version is very slightly
  changed to import the module "random" and to use raw_input() instead of input().

* rock-paper-scissors-staff.py: another implementation written by GWC staff.
