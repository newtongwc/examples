Your Dad says he'll make you hot chocolate at 8PM if you work diligently until then. You work
hard but then your Dad realizes there is no cocoa powder in the house.
<p>
    Do you
    <a href="store.html">ask your Dad to go to the store and get some cocoa powder</a> or
    <a href="wait.html">say you can wait until tomorrow</a>?
