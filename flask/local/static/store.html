    Your Dad obligingly goes to the store to get cocoa powder. While he is gone, two trolls
    break into your house and drink up all your milk. Your Dad returns, helps you clean
    up the mess, but refuses to make you hot chocolate with water. You throw a fit and
    tear up your homework.
</p>
<p>
    The end.
